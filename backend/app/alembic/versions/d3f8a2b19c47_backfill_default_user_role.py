"""backfill the baseline user role onto existing accounts

Every account provisioned from now on is granted the baseline ``user`` role at
provisioning time. This backfills that role onto accounts that predate the
change, so existing users retain access to their permission-gated resources
(items, OCR documents, conversations). Idempotent: a user that already holds
the role is skipped, and if the role has not been seeded yet the statement
matches nothing and is a no-op.
